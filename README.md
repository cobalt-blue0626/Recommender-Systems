# Recommender-Systems
In this homework, you are asked to implement four different recommendation methods without
using any recommendation packages. Specifically, you need to implement User‐based Collaborative
Filtering, Item‐based Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Method, and Latent Factor Model (Matrix
Factorization) without and with regularization, global mean, user bias, and item bias. Then your tasks
are to compare the performance of these typical recommendation methods with different settings.
